## About The Project
</br>

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](screenshot.PNG)

The game of life is a automaton where each cell is represented as a simple square. If the square is black, the cell is alive, if not, the cell is dead. The goal is to simulate the evolutions there life cycle using the following simple rules:

* Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).
* Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation).
* Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
* Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours comes to life.
